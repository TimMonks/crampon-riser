# crampon-riser
SolidWorks design for a ski or splitboard crampon riser that uses dynafit compatible bindings. 
Intended for splitboards, but probably OK for skis too. 
I found that it meets my requirements, but am no expert on ski/split equipment safety, 
so make your own decisions and ensure you carefully check it safely meets your needs before using.
